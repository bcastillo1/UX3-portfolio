    "string": "Hello! My name in Brittany Castillo and I am a graduate of Eastern Washington University with a degree in Visual Communication Design and a Certificate in User Experience Design(UX). UX to me means that there is accessibility and ease of use for anyone using the website or product. I am experienced in usability and heuristic testing, as well as utilizing development and prototyping tools. I have participated in the SPACED competition, Future Ada’s Django girls code weekend, and am currently developing a new website for a community church. \rWhen not working on projects or attending local events, I like to travel and visit friends. I have been to 19/50 states, to the boarder of both Canada and Mexico, and was in Japan for a month. My favorite part about traveling to comparing the culture and life style of the people in the new location to my hometown. Finding the differences and similarities gives me a better understanding of individual’s backgrounds and thus makes me a better UX designer. I like to document my travels and life by taking photos- I have many photos out my front windshield at gorgeous landscapes and blurred out roads as I pass them by; those pictures, because I am often driving by myself, are like little notes to myself reminding me of the free feeling that comes with driving down a highway and jamming out to a new song or mix. I enjoy finding the subtle characteristics of a town and documenting them in a photograph. Trying to capture the mood and tell a story is a challenge I enjoy bringing to every photo I take, be that of a town or a person. I believe that taking a moment to be still and notice what is around one’s self is important not only for noticing the subtlies of what’s around, but also to further understand the self. \r"
