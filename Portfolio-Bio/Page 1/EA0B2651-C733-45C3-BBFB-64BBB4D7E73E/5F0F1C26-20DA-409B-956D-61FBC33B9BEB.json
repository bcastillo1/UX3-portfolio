My name in Brittany Castillo and I am a graduate of Eastern Washington University with a degree in Visual Communication Design and a Certificate in User Experience Design(UX). UX to me means that there is accessibility and ease of use for anyone using the website or product. I am experienced in usability and heuristic testing, as well as utilizing development and prototyping tools. I have participated in the SPACED competition, Future Ada’s Django girls code weekend, and am currently developing a new website for a community church. \rWhen not working on projects or attending local events, I like to travel and visit friends. I have been to 19/50 states, to the boarder of both Canada and Mexico, and was in Japan for a month. My favorite part about traveling to comparing the culture and life style of the people in the new location to my hometown. Finding the differences and similarities gives me a better understanding of individual’s backgrounds and thus makes me a better UX designer. I like to document my travels and life by taking photos- I have many photos out my front windshield at gorgeous landscapes and blurred out roads as I pass them by; those pictures, because I am often driving by myself, are like little notes to myself reminding me of the free feeling that comes with driving down a highway and jamming out to a new song or mix. I enjoy finding the subtle characteristics of a town and documenting them in a photograph. Trying to capture the mood and tell a story is a challenge I enjoy bringing to every photo I take, be that of a town or a person. I believe that taking a moment to be still and notice what is around one’s self is important not only for noticing the subtlies of what’s around, but also to further understand the self. \r \r150 WORDS (138)\rHello!
